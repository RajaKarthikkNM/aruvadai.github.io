							Every year world health organization follow a theme as part of World mental health day. Likewise, in the year of 2019 also they had formulated a theme which was on “YOUNG PEOPLE AND MENTAL HEALTH IN CHANGING WORLD. Healthy young adults are the significant contributors to the workforce, their families and communities and society as a whole. Being a responsible citizen, it is our duty to create a happy and healthy environment for the students to grow and evolve personally and professionally.<br><br>
							</p>
							<p align='justify'>
							Keeping this in mind,  ARUVADAI – Psychological support services had a vision to prevent mental distress and promote mental resilience for young people across the city.  Through the statistics, we came to know the rate of suicides had been increased among the students from diverse backgrounds since 2014. Shockingly, Chennai ranks the top in suicides that are been involved by Young population.  Considering these findings,  On behalf  of ARUVADAI – Psychological support services,  a team of  youngsters have decided to do an innovative act and that would bring out positive impact on mental well being among people all over the city. As an initiative for mental health awareness, we started to prepare posters which was carried on positive affirmation quotes connoted to suicide prevention. With the help of energetic and enthusiastic youngsters, we posted the quotes in 50 different places of chennai to public's notice where suicide has happened so far and in places that are vulnerable to invite suicidals. The places include Bridges, railway stations, Schools, Tea shops, Bus stands, Super markets, Petrol bunks, Hospitals, Residential Areas.<br><br>
							</p>
							<p align='justify'>
							A step further ahead, we apporoached the people randomly and asked them how do they feel while they look at these posters in some public places. With their permission, we recorded their response in a video to create a platform for others to know the importance of mental well being. The public’s response to this event was very well recognised and appreciated. They felt that this should be done in entire state to prevent suicide among young minds. On a positive note, they suggested that talking to themselves positively and productively is a way to seek out solutions for all kinds of problems. <br><br>

							The child sexual abuse is rapidly increasing day by day across the city irrespective of age, gender, education, social and family status. More than 50% of children were being abused in india. Educating the child about sexual abuse by differentiating safe and unsafe touch leads to ambiguity about themselves and afraid of society too. It is our responsibilty to provide safe and secure environment for young children. By holding this conviction, ARUVADAI started to educate and empower the children on safe and unsafe touch in government schools. The importance of safe and unsafe touch was conducted on government schools because most of the children are from low socio-economic status where their parents are not educated to aware of the child's problems, acknowledge and accept their child feelings too. It is again turbulence period for children to talk out their feelings openly in such situations. While doing these program, many children broke down in tears uncontrollably and somehow the facilitator and teachers made them feel comfort. It is evident that they have experienced such traumatic incidents and did not share to anyone else.   We believe that “Little drops of water make the mighty ocean”. Through our training programs we would like to bring awareness about  how to be more confident and courageous to protect themselves from the dangerous sitations. Prevention of child sexual abuse begins with 3 A’S:<br><br></p>
